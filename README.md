# db-picture
Python code sample to build a SQLite picture database (picture taken from by default /Picture directory on Linux).
For each picture, the date, location... is read using PIL and Bing (via geopy API) and stored in the database.
This database is used by my Angular App to show the picture (upcoming...)
